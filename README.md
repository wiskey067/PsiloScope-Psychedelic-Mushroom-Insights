# PsiloScope-Visual-Analytics-of-Psychedelic-Compound-Dynamics-in-Mushrooms


This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard that explores the chemical and physical characteristics of mushrooms containing psilocybin, a naturally occurring psychedelic compound. Using visual analytics, the dashboard uncovers relationships between Texture Energy and Psilocibina (psilocybin concentration), enabling users to spot patterns, correlations, and anomalies in compound behavior across various mushroom species.
